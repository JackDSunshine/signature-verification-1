# signature-verification

The paper discussing the project's approach and results can be found here:
[Signature Embedding: Writer Independent Offline Signature Verification with Deep Metric Learning](https://hpi.de/fileadmin/user_upload/fachgebiete/meinel/tele-task/papers/isvc16_Hannes.pdf)

## Please refer to my re-implementation of the system

I am working on a cleaner and optimized implementation of the system: https://github.com/hrantzsch/signature-embedding.

As long as the work on the new project has not processed to a point where it can be used, feel free to file an issue if you require assistance with this repository.
